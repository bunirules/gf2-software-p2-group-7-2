# GF2 Software IIA Project

## Description
This repository contains a logic circuit simulator. A circuit can be inputted a a text definition file and then the circuit can be simulated with either a GUI or a command line interface.

## Text definition files
The text definition files are based on an EBNF grammar that is defined in [EBNF/logic_def.txt](EBNF/logic_def.txt). To aid in understanding this grammar, example files and matching circuits can be found in both the [EBNF](EBNF/) and [Final/examples_files](Final/example_files/) folders.

## Running the simulator
The final implementation of this simulator is the [Final](Final/) folder.
To run the simulator, run the file [logsim.py](Final/logsim.py). For help on how to select the interface you want, run "logsim.py -h".
